  RattlEye demonstrated at SIGGRAPH 2022. Gaze-based thermal feedback enables vision-like thermal experience.
</p>

  RattlEye is a new media experience where people feel thermal sensation according to their gaze.
  Just like you perceive visible lights according to your gaze in vision, you can perceive infrared rays (thermal sensation) according to your gaze in RattlEye.
  You can "see" the world through your skin.
  People often reacts like, "Wow! It works!"

<h2>CONCEPT</h2>
<p style="font-size: 14px;font-weight:400">
  Infrared light, along with visible light, is emitted from the sun and thermal light sources and is reflected back into the world to reach us.
  Therefore, in perceiving the world, we not only see visible light with our eyes, but also feel heat with our skin.
  However, temperature sensation has a lower spatial resolution than vision, and it also does not have the same immediate effect on our attention, consciousness, and perceptual world as vision does.
  I thought that the strong connection of vision to attention, consciousness, and the perceptual world is due to the fact that vision is perceived at high speeds in response to the gaze, something that is constantly interacting with attention, consciousness, and the perceptual world. I also considered that spatial scanning by gaze converts the fast refresh of the limited perceptual unit of central vision into spatial perception.
  (As an aside, Richard A. Bolt's Gaze-orchestrated dynamic windows at MIT seems to have applied similar ideas to the interface.)
  Therefore, to visualize temperature sensation, we developed the RattlEye, which provides high refresh rate thermal feedback in response to eye gaze.
