<h2>Good Research</h2>
<p style="font-size: 14px;font-weight:400">
- **Dos**
  - *Novelty, Advancement, and a "Wow" Factor*
    * Not just high-quality content, but innovation in interaction or media technology is required.
    * Like patents, not only novelty and usefulness, but advancement is essential.
    * Research should include an element of surprise: The Egg of Columbus or "It changes how I see the world."
  - *Clear Concept and Research Question*
    * The research should have a well-defined claim and answer the 5W1H: When, Where, Who, What, Why, and How.
    * One should clearly explain what the study is and what kind of system it proposes.
  - *Open-Endedness and Reusability*
    * The system should encourage users to imagine "how they would use it" themselves.
    * Avoid over-polished content that limits the general implications as a media system.
  - *Power to Move and Touch People*
    * Research that deeply resonates with participants or readers, even without technical novelty, is valuable.
    * Shifting perspectives and evoking emotion are considered important academic contributions.
  - *Generality and Cross-Field Verification*
    * Great research often derives principles that generalize across different fields.
    * The principles and laws emerging when you try to generalize could be the essense of knowledge.
  - *Exploratory and Heuristic Approach*
    * Focus on discovery through iteration, including testing new sensing or feedback mechanisms.
    * Be open to unexpected findings that can transform the project fundamentally.
  - *Playfulness and Human Creativity*
    * Embrace the fun and curiosity in research.
    * Projects with cultural and emotional richness, like amusement robots, leave lasting impressions.

- **What Should Be Avoided**
  - *Well-Made but Technically Unoriginal Content*
    * Visually or experientially appealing projects without technical or research novelty are not suitable for good venues.
  - *Incremental Feature Accumulation*
    * Simply responding to feedback with small updates can lead to losing the core idea.
    * Research should focus on the *inherent strength* of an idea, not just add-ons.
  - *Being Trapped by "Sunk Cost"*
    * Spending time on an idea shouldn't justify clinging to it.
    * Be brave enough to *pivot* when needed.
  - *Disjointed or Inconsistent Papers*
    * Avoid "dragon head, snake tail" papers where the introduction, methods, and results lack coherence.
    * Misalignment between the stated ideals and actual impact weakens the research.
  - *Relying Solely on External Recognition*
    * External recognition is valuable, but it should not be the primary motivation.
    * Focus on whether the project has the potential to truly *generate something meaningful*.

<h2>Submission Policy</h2>
<p style="font-size: 14px;font-weight:400">
  - Check with other authors if we can submit the paper at least a few weeks before the deadline.
  - In principle, submit full papers.
  - Exception:
    * Peer-reviewed demos in experience halls (e.g., SIGGRAPH E-Tech) if approved after the demos to the PI.
    * When recommended by the PI based on the lab's strategy.
    * When the travels are funded personally.

<h2>Underlying Thought</h2>
<p style="font-size: 14px;font-weight:400">
  - Respecting De Facto Standards
    * Full papers are the de facto standard for presenting outcomes to the research community and provoking discussion in our research domain.
    * Your performance is judged by the number of full papers.
      * While the content matters, people only begin to evaluate it after a certain number of publications is reached.
      * It is the main evaluation metric until you obtain a PhD or become a PI.
      * It is used in assessments for scholarships.

  - Brand of Individual, Lab, School, and Conference
    * Getting a paper accepted is not the goal; what matters is how it leads to:
      * Meaningful discussions
      * Potential collaborations
    * Reviewers are volunteers.
      * Thus, the benchmark for submission is whether the paper reaches a quality where reviewers feel, "I'm glad I reviewed this."
    * Reviewers are not academic advisors.
      * Even in a double-blind review process, if a lab/school repeatedly submits low-quality papers or budget proposals, negative rumors will inevitably spread.
    * Conversely, consistently presenting good research:
      * Builds a fan base within the community.
      * Encourages strong support from reviewers when opinions are divided.
      * Establishes the lab's brand.
    * As more high-quality research is presented at a conference:
      * The conference's brand also improves.
      * This serves as a key motivation for conference organizers.

  - Value of Experience
    * In the field of interactive technologies involving humans (e.g., VR and haptics) there seems to be a value that is difficult to fully capture in papers or justify solely through user study results.
    * Videos and demos help fill the gaps that are hard to express through formulas or natural language.
    * Quality of demos is extremely important.
      * SIGGRAPH E-Tech is valuable because many stakeholders get to experience the work in person.
      * Good demos can lead to future support in the future.
      * On the flip side, no matter how good the concept is, if the quality of the video or demo is poor, the value of the research itself may be perceived as low.

  - Responsibility of PI and PhD Students to Allocate Lab Resources
    * PIs and PhD students are responsible for creating an environment where members can conduct stable research activities.
    * Currently, university labs do not receive consistent funding.
      * Financial conditions can vary greatly from year to year, depending on competitive funding and joint research grants with companies.
    * PI has a duty to explain the research outcomes and their value to stakeholders such as funding bodies.
      * If this is insufficient, funding may be cut, or poor evaluations may be made public, making it harder to secure future funding.
    * At the same time, unplanned ideas or students' self-motivated initiatives can lead to future research projects and should be valued as much as possible.
      * While efforts should be made to link these unexpected ideas to existing projects and explain them to stakeholders, there are practical limits to this.
    * For these reasons, resource allocation (such as budgets, project funding, or travel expenses) should not be handled on a first-come, first-served basis.
      * Instead, PI needs to assess and prioritize based on each project's importance to ensure accountability.
