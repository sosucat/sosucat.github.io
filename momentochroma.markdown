Keep staring at the dot at the center of the inverted color image. And you can experience a momental colorization of the black-and-white image.

The development of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) has made it possible to achieve AI colorization of old black-and-white photographs with some accuracy.
This is a fantastic technology that adds a sense of realism to memories that until now could only be seen in black and white, as if they were being experienced now.
However, there are two areas for improvement here.
The first is that the photographic medium cuts and fixes reality in time.
While the photograph makes it possible to observe the moment it cuts out, it loses the ephemerality, earnestness and aura that derives from the implicit understanding that the scene can only exist at that moment.
For example, the change in the facial expression of the person in front of us, which changes from moment to moment and which we can no longer experience in the next moment, causes us to cherish what is in front of us and cherish what has passed as a memory.
Second, the colours produced by AI colourisation are not always accurate.
