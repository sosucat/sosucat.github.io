Keep staring at the dot at the center of the inverted color image. And you can experience a momental colorization of the black-and-white image.

The development of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) has made it possible to achieve AI colorization of old black-and-white photographs with some accuracy.
This is a fantastic technology that adds a sense of realism to memories that until now could only be seen in black and white, as if they were being experienced now.
However, there are two areas for improvement here.
<br>
The first is that photograph cuts and fixes reality in time.
While the photograph makes it possible to observe the moment it cuts out, it loses the ephemerality, earnestness and aura that derives from the implicit understanding that the scene can only exist at that moment.
For example, the facial expression of the person in front of us, which changes from moment to moment and which we can no longer experience in the next moment, causes us to cherish what is in front of us and what has passed as a memory.
However, in a photograph, the same facial expression is fixed for a long time, so there is no such "affection for the moment".
<br>
Second, the colours produced by AI colourisation are not always accurate.
This is due to both technical and perceptual factors.
Technical factors include the low resolution and high noise content of older photographs, as well as the fact that photographs often contain objects that are not present in modern training data.
Perceptual factors include the difference between the visual environment at the time the photograph was taken and that of the person viewing the photograph, and the fact that the colors in the memory do not always match the "physically accurate" colors.

Regarding this inaccuracy of AI colorization, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3354918.3361904" style="color:inherit; text-decoration:underline">Niwata and Watanave</a> offer an interesting solution.
They showed AI-colorized photos to the people involved in the shoot and manually corrected the colors as they conversed about their memories of the time.
This is a fantastic example of AI-human collaboration in which the person has agency, i.e., the AI generates the colored photos as a trigger and aid to the people's interaction and memory, rather than presenting them to the people as the truth.

  The process of making MomentoChroma. The colorized photo is generated by the GAN, such as <a href="https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify#nogan-based-deoldify-model" style="color:inherit; text-decoration:underline">NoGAN-Based DeOldify Model</a> or <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/colorizer" style="color:inherit; text-decoration:underline">DeepAI Image Colorization</a>.
  Then, the generated colored image is inverted, and a dot is put at the center (you can use any image editing program/software/<a href="https://pinetools.com/invert-image-colors" style="color:inherit; text-decoration:underline">online service</a>).
  Finally, the MomentoChroma gif file consisting of the inverted image (12 sec) and the original black-and-white image (6 sec) is created (you can use any program/software/<a href="https://ezgif.com/maker" style="color:inherit; text-decoration:underline">online service</a>).
